# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project provides an easy-to-use method of task and event tracking by the business hour. It allows for easy visualization of the day ahead. I learned a lot about setting and getting local storage in this challenge, as well as callback functions and using event listeners in jquery. I was motivated to take everything that I had learned through the lessons and apply them in a practical website. I wanted to build this project to challenge myself. I found it very exciting to learn bootstrap and jQuery together.

## Usage

To use the work day scheduler, click on the empty box next to the hour you would like to note an event or task for. To save your changes, click on the blue save button to the right of the time slot. A screenshot is provided below of what the password generator looks like:
